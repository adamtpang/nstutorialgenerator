# Push to GitHub - Fixed! ✅

## What I Fixed

I removed your API key from `UPDATES.md` to pass GitHub's push protection.

## Push Now

Since the commit has been amended, you need to force push:

```bash
git push --force
```

Or if you prefer a safer approach:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

## What Changed

The file `UPDATES.md` now shows:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Instead of your actual key. The key is still safe in your `.env.local` file (which is properly ignored by git).

## After Pushing

1. **Push your code**: `git push --force`
2. **Go to Vercel**: Import your GitHub repository
3. **Add environment variable** in Vercel:
   - Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Value: (copy from your `.env.local` file)
4. **Deploy!**

## Alternative: Use the Deploy Script

```bash
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```

This will handle everything for you!

**Your API key is safe** - it's only in `.env.local` which is in `.gitignore`. ✅
