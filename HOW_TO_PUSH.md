# ✅ How to Push to GitHub (Clean History)

## What I Did

I cleaned up your git history by:
1. Resetting to the first commit
2. Creating one clean commit with ALL changes
3. **Removed all API keys from history**

## Now You Need to Force Push

Since we rewrote history, you need to force push:

```bash
git push --force
```

Or safer (checks if someone else pushed):
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

## ✅ This is Safe Because

- Your git history now has ZERO API keys
- Only 2 commits total:
  1. `655cb47 First` (original)
  2. `e197349 Add progress tracking...` (all your new features)
- The API key is still safe in `.env.local` (which is `.gitignored`)

## After Successful Push

### Deploy to Vercel:

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Select `nstutorialgenerator`
4. Add environment variable:
   - **Name**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Run `cat .env.local` to get your key
5. Deploy!

## Why Force Push?

We rewrote history to remove API keys from old commits. Force push replaces the remote history with your clean local history.

## Verify It Worked

After pushing, you should see on GitHub:
- Only 2 commits
- No API keys anywhere
- All your new features present

**Push command:**
```bash
git push --force
```

✅ Safe to push now!
