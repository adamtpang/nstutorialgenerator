## Tutorial Information

- **Target Audience:** Beginner developers
- **Format:** Step-by-step guide with code examples
- **Time to Complete:** 2 hours

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Node.js and npm installed
- Familiarity with command line
- Understanding of HTTP methods

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Set up an Express.js project from scratch
- Create RESTful API endpoints
- Implement middleware for common tasks
- Handle errors gracefully
- Connect to a database
- Test API endpoints

## Tutorial Outline

### 1. Setting Up Your Express.js Project

Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js along with essential dependencies.

**Topics covered:**
  - Creating package.json
  - Installing Express.js
  - Project structure setup
  - Basic server configuration

**[TODO: Expand this section with:]**
- Detailed explanation of concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples with comments
- Screenshots or diagrams (if applicable)
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

```javascript
// Example: Basic Express server setup
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Expected outcome:** A running Express server that responds to basic requests

### 2. Creating Your First Route

Learn how to define routes and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

**Topics covered:**
  - Route definition
  - HTTP methods
  - Request and response objects
  - Route parameters

**[TODO: Expand this section with:]**
- Detailed explanation of concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples with comments
- Screenshots or diagrams (if applicable)
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

```javascript
// Example: Defining routes
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Add implementation
});
```

**Expected outcome:** Working API endpoints that respond to HTTP requests

### 3. Implementing Middleware

Understand middleware functions and how to use them for common tasks like parsing JSON and logging.

**Topics covered:**
  - Middleware concept
  - Built-in middleware
  - Custom middleware
  - Middleware order

**[TODO: Expand this section with:]**
- Detailed explanation of concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples with comments
- Screenshots or diagrams (if applicable)
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

```javascript
// Example: Using middleware
app.use(express.json());
```

**Expected outcome:** Properly configured middleware pipeline

### 4. Error Handling

Set up robust error handling to manage both synchronous and asynchronous errors.

**Topics covered:**
  - Error handling middleware
  - Try-catch blocks
  - Async error handling
  - Custom error classes

**[TODO: Expand this section with:]**
- Detailed explanation of concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples with comments
- Screenshots or diagrams (if applicable)
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting

```javascript
// Example: Error handling
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // TODO: Add error handling logic
});
```

**Expected outcome:** API that handles errors gracefully

### 5. Database Integration

Connect your API to a database to persist data.

**Topics covered:**
  - Database selection
  - Connection setup
  - CRUD operations
  - Data validation

**[TODO: Expand this section with:]**
- Detailed explanation of concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples with comments

// Example: Database connection placeholder
```

**Expected outcome:** API connected to database with working CRUD operations

### 6. Testing Your API

Learn how to test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

**Topics covered:**
  - API testing tools
  - Testing different HTTP methods
  - Request/response validation
  - Debugging techniques
